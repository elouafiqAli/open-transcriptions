Everybody wants to know about Palestine and
0:04 what we can do to help well
0:09 the last time I went
0:12 to the region and spoke to somebody
0:15 who really has been helping them he said
0:19 why are you Muslims in the West so preoccupied with things
0:23 in our backyard rather than sorting out things in your own backyard
0:26 if you really want to help the whole Ummah globally
0:30 then build up your own communities until you a strong enough to make a difference
0:34 globally
0:35 a, yelling at demonstrations
0:39 it's not "Haram", but it's not going to make any difference to US foreign policy
0:43 at the moment the US foreign policy
0:47 will be swayed by communities that are well-entrenched
0:50 and are respected and economically powerful 
0:54 US foreign policy will not be swayed
0:56 even by a block vote from 20 million US muslims
0:60 if they don't represent a significant community
1:02 so if you want to help Palestine and don't get involved in some kind of
1:07 political lobbying in the expectation that is actually going to make a difference
1:11 what Muslim campaigns has ever contributed even
1:15 to swaying by one percent any of the decisions that the Pentagon and the
1:20 State Department has undertaken
1:22 people try and are sincere but it doesn't in practice make a difference
1:26 if it did then we should do it. The reality is that it doesn't
1:29 what.. so what this guy was telling me and he's somebody who has given millions to
1:33 palestinian things of all kinds he said
1:37 sort out your own communities because you can make a difference tough
1:40 to sort out the situation in your mosque sort out the weak in your communities
1:44 try and create strong British
1:48 Islam that the government can begin to take seriously try and unify yourselves
1:52 so that the government conceive that you are serious and
1:55 represented in one voice sort yourselves out and then think about
2:00 other things that are in the wider world
2:03 because Islam is not just about the expression of emotional solidarity
2:07 Islam is about dealing with "wa bda'â bi man taûul"(arabic)
2:11 begin with your own family responsibility starts at home and in the
2:15 neighborhood and then the local
2:17 mosque community and and then and then and then
2:20 now if everybody is wealthy in your community which is unlikely or there's
2:25 nobody in need of help
2:26 which is unlikely but if that's your perception of course you can send
2:30 donations to help the needy and
2:33 make absolutely sure that you are sending it through
2:36 individuals that you know at every stage of the way otherwise you will
2:40 nowadays will end up in in a cage in cuba
2:43 that's the situation now that's fine that's "Sadaqa" at a the distance 
2:48 that's "Dabiha" in Gaza that's fine many people do that
2:51 but the political thing there's nothing we can do
2:54 until we have become strong enough for the
2:58 significant forces in the world to take us seriously
