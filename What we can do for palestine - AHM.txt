Everybody wants to know about Palestine and
0:04 what we can do to help well
0:09 the last time I went
0:12 to the region and spoke to somebody
0:15 who really has been helping them he said
0:19 why are you Muslims in the West so preoccupied with things
0:23 in our backyard rather than sorting out things in your own backyard
0:26 if you really want to help the whole Ummah globally
0:30 then build up your own communities until you a strong enough to make a difference
0:34 globally
0:35 a, yelling at demonstrations
0:39 it's not "Haram", but it's not going to make any difference to US foreign policy
0:43 at the moment the US foreign policy
0:47 will be swayed by communities that are well-entrenched
0:50 and I respected and economically powerful US foreign policy will not be
0:55 swayed
0:56 even by a block vote from 20 million
0:59  US muslims if they did represent a significant community
1:02 so if you want to help palestine and don't get involved in some kind of
1:07 political
1:08 lobbying in the expectation that is actually going to make a difference
1:11 what most in campaign has other contributed even
1:15 to swaying by one percent any of the decisions that the Pentagon and the
1:20 State Department has undertaken
1:22 people try and are sincere but it doesn't in practice make a difference
1:26 if it did then we should do it reality is that it doesn't
1:29 what so what this guy was telling me and his somebody has given millions to
1:33  palestinian things of all all kinds he said
1:37 sort out your own communities because you can make a difference to sort out
1:41 the situation in your mosque sort out the week in your communities
1:44 try and create strong British
1:48 Islam that the government can begin to take seriously try and unify yourselves
1:52 so that the government conceive that your serious and
1:55 represented one voice sort yourselves out and then think about
2:00 on things that a in the wider world
2:03 because islam is not just about the expression of emotional solidarity
2:07 islam is about dealing with "wa ibda2 bi man ta3ud"
2:11 begin with your own family responsibility starts at home and in the
2:15 neighborhood and then the local
2:17 mosque community and and then and then and then
2:20 now if everybody is wealthy in your community which is unlikely all there's
2:25 nobody in need of help
2:26 which is unlikely but if that's your perception of course you can send
2:30 donations to help the needy and
2:33 make absolutely sure that you'll sending its through
2:36 individuals that you know at every stage the way otherwise you will
2:40 nowadays will end up in in a cage in cuba
2:43 that's the situation now that's fine that's Sadaqa at a the distance that
2:48 Dabiha in gaza that's fine many people do that
2:51 but the political thing there's nothing we can do
2:54 until we have become strong enough for the
2:58 significant forces in the world to take us seriously
